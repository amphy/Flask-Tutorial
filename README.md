# Flask-Tutorial
This is a Flask Tutorial for creating Flask applications with Apache.

# Introduction
When I was first learning to create web applications, the world was a very large place. There are so many technologies out there that it can be hard to select just one. At the time, I knew little about web development; my server had an Apache server set up and the only way I had heard of using Apache before was with PHP. However, when working on an API challenge with a friend, whose specialty was Python, we had to find some way to use Python on the web which lead us to the discovery of two popular Python frameworks: Django and Flask. We ended up going with Flask.

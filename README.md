# Flask-Tutorial
This is a Flask Tutorial for creating Flask applications with Apache.

# Introduction
When I was first learning to create web applications, the world was a very large place. There are so many technologies out there that it can be hard to select just one. At the time, I knew little about web development; my server had an Apache server set up and the only way I had heard of using Apache before was with PHP. However, when working on an API challenge with a friend, whose specialty was Python, we had to find some way to use Python on the web which lead us to the discovery of two popular Python frameworks: Django and Flask. We ended up going with Flask.

However, the setup with Flask was very difficult. Since my webserver was an Apache server (and because I didnâ€™t realize Flask itself could serve pages), I had to scour the web to find some way to configure my Flask setup to work with Apache. It was very difficult to find any documentation and ended with me having to work for hours before Flask was finally working with Apache. To help others avoid that, I wanted to create a tutorial that walked you step by step through creating a Flask application and serving it through Apache (if you chose that route). An alternative to this is to serve the Flask application through something like Heroku.

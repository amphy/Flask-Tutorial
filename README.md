# Flask-Tutorial
This is a Flask Tutorial for creating Flask applications with Apache.

# Introduction
When I was first learning to create web applications, the world was a very large place. There are so many technologies out there that it can be hard to select just one. At the time, I knew little about web development; my server had an Apache server set up and the only way I had heard of using Apache before was with PHP. However, when working on an API challenge with a friend, whose specialty was Python, we had to find some way to use Python on the web which lead us to the discovery of two popular Python frameworks: Django and Flask. We ended up going with Flask.

However, the setup with Flask was very difficult. Since my webserver was an Apache server (and because I didnâ€™t realize Flask itself could serve pages), I had to scour the web to find some way to configure my Flask setup to work with Apache. It was very difficult to find any documentation and ended with me having to work for hours before Flask was finally working with Apache. To help others avoid that, I wanted to create a tutorial that walked you step by step through creating a Flask application and serving it through Apache (if you chose that route). An alternative to this is to serve the Flask application through something like Heroku.

All of these instructions are for a Unix based system.

# Installing Flask

The first step is to install Flask from the official site. The documentation walks you through installing Flask. The docs recommend that you use a virtual environment when working with Flask on your system. If virtualenv is not installed on your system, you can use

$ sudo easy_install virtualenv
$ sudo pip install virtualenv
$ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv

One of the three above options should work for installing virtualenv. Once that is done, we then make sure we are in the directory where our project will be and create a virtual environment

$ cd myApplication
$ virtualenv venv

This will create a virtual environment called venv in our myApplication directory. To activate your virtual environment, you can use

$ . venv/bin/activate
The next step is to then install Flask using pip. If you already have pip on your system, you can simply use

$ pip install Flask
